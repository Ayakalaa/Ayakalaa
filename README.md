Hello...
(wow i really hate these "introductions, i probably should get on with it!)

I've done multiple things on here, a few fun projects that went nowhere, but now, an actual game that doesn't go into hiatus for eternity!

I (still) run the https://www.youtube.com/@WeatherSeven WeatherSTAR 4000 streams, you can find music used here. It isn't my primary project/hobby so it's likely it'll go neglected but will be relooked at when I remember.

I'm non-binary, but they/them or she/her pronouns are fine.
